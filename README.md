# Crop Recommendation System

## Overview
The **Crop Recommendation System** is a machine learning-based web application that helps farmers determine the best crop to grow based on environmental conditions. The system uses multiple machine learning models and is deployed using Flask with a Bootstrap-powered frontend.

## Features
- Accepts user input for soil and environmental parameters.
- Uses multiple ML models: **RBF Kernel, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and SVC**.
- Provides crop recommendations based on **RBF Kernel** predictions.
- Web-based interface using Flask and Bootstrap.

## Technologies Used
- **Machine Learning Models:**
  - RBF Kernel
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Naive Bayes
  - SVC (Support Vector Classification)
- **Backend:** Flask
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Deployment:** Flask

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tejasshitole0022/Crop_recommendation_system.git
   cd Crop_recommendation_system
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
4. Open the browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   ```

## Usage
1. Enter soil and environmental parameters in the web form.
2. Click on **Predict**.
3. The system will recommend the best crop based on **RBF Kernel** predictions.
